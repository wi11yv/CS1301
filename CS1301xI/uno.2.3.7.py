#In the card game Uno, players take turns playing cards on
#top a growing pile of cards facing up. On your turn, the
#card you put down must meet one of two conditions:
#
# - It must either have the same color _or_ the same value
#   as the previous card, or
# - It must be black. Black cards (Wild and Wild Draw 4) may
#   be played at any time, no matter the value of the previous
#   card.
#
#Write some code that prints True if the card represented by
#current_color and current_value may be played on top of the
#card represented by previous_color and previous_value. Print
#False if it may not be played.
#
#You may assume that previous_color will never be Black.


#Add your code here!
print((previous_color == current_color) or (previous_value == current_value) or (current_color == "Black"))
