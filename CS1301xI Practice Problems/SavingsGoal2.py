#Last problem, we calculated how much money a person would
#have to invest to reach a certain savings goal. Now, let's
#modify that to instead take a principal, interest rate,
#number of years, and savings goal, and report whether or not
#the person will meet their savings goal.
#
#Add some code below that will calculate whether the
#investment described by the values above will meet the given
#goal. If it will, print True. If it will not, print False.
#
#As a reminder, the formula for the value of an account after
#a given time (in number of years) is:
#
#  Current Value = principal * e ^ (rate * number of years)
#
#Remember, you can access e using math.e as long as you don't
#change the next line. You don't need to worry about rounding
#on this problem.
import math

#Add your code here!

# Current Value = principal * e ^ (rate * number of years)
current_value = principal * math.e ** (rate * years)
print(current_value >= goal)
