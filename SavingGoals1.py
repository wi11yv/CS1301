#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Earlier, we created a program that would calculate the
#value of an investment account after a certain period of
#time using the formula Amount = Principal * e^(Rate * Time).
#
#Let's revisit that, but let's flip the question around.
#Instead of asking, "What will the value of this account
#be?", let's instead ask, "How much do I need to invest to
#have a certain amount by a certain year?" For example,
#"How much do I need to invest to have $50,000 in 5 years
#at 5% (0.05) interest?"
#
#Mathematically, the formula for this is:
#
#  goal / e ^ (rate * number of years) = principal
#
#Add some code below that will print the amount of principal
#needed to reach the given savings goal within the number of
#years and interest rate specified.
#
#In printing your response, you should round the answer to
#two decimal places. Remember, you can do this with this
#code (assuming that your principal is stored in a variable
#called 'principal'): rounded_principal = round(principal, 2)
#
#Remember, you can access e using math.e as long as you don't
#change the next line.
import math

#Add your code here!
#  goal / e ^ (rate * number of years) = principal
principal = goal / math.e ** (rate * years)
print(round(principal, 2))
