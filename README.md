# CS1301xI
Introduction to Python Programming Georgia Tech

Hello my name is Will and this is my first respository. I'm making it so I can track my progress and projects in the class CS1301xl from GA Tech. I am taking this class so that I can apply for the GA Tech master's in computer science with a specialization in machine learning.

Chapters 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 comprise Unit 1; Chapters 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 comprise Unit 2; and all seven of these chapters together comprise CS1301xI.

dedicate a couple hours a day every day to watching lecture material, completing exercises, and getting started on problems. In computing, it's common to encounter challenges that require you to step back and give your mind a day to think over them, but you can only do that if you start early!

As a verified learner, your grade in this course is derived from two categories:

- Problem Sets: 70% (3 problem sets, each worth ~23% of your average)
- Test: 30% (1 test, worth 30% of your average)

There are also exercises inside the chapters; however, to preserve access to these for free learners under edX's policies, these no longer count toward your final grade in the course. However, we encourage working on these for practice!

All exercises and problem sets allow unlimited attempts, although they may be time-throttled to encourage you to put forth your best effort instead of guessing. Coding problems on the tests allow unlimited attempts, but multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank problems may offer a limited number of attempts. The course is deliberately designed so that it may be _passed_ (and a certificate obtained) with the exercises and problem sets alone, but to achieve a good grade, you'll need to do well on the test as well.

## Exercises (Ungraded)

Every chapter has exercises. These exercises are meant to be completed while you're learning the material to give you feedback on how well you're progressing. There are two categories of exercises:

- **EdX Exercises:** these are automatically-evaluated multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank exercises that are interspersed between many of the lecture videos. You may attempt these as many times as you need to get the answer right.
- **Programming Exercises:** these are automatically-evaluated programming exercises that are also interspersed between the lecture videos. These will ask you to write or modify existing code. You can run the code that you write directly in the browser, and then submit it for instant grading. You may attempt these as many times as you need to get the answer right.

The number of exercises in each category will vary from chapter to chapter; you can always check on your progress on the Progress page.

## Problem Sets: 70%

Substantive chapters have problem sets. For this course, those are Chapters 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.

Like exercises, there are both EdX problems (multiple choice and fill in the blank) and programming problems (writing and submitting your own code). Problem sets are grouped together at the end of chapters on the pages marked Problem Set.

You may check on your progress through the problem sets on the Progress page.

## Practice Tests (Ungraded)

At the conclusion of the course, we have provided two practice tests. These practice tests mimic the structure and requirements of the real test: they has the same number of problems, the problems test similar concepts, and the difficulty is approximately the same. Practice Test 2 is actually the real test used during last year's run of the course.

We recommend timing yourself on the practice tests to gauge your readiness for the real test. On the real test, you will have two hours; if you can complete the practice tests in 2 hours each, you are likely prepared for the real test.

## Test: 30%

At the conclusion of the course, there will be a final test. This is the Unit 2 Test completed by Georgia Tech CS1301 students in 2020. As a Verified Certificate student, the test will be timed: you will have two hours to complete the test.

The test will involve a mix of multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and live coding problems. You will receive live feedback during the test about the correctness of your answers; in many ways, the test is like a timed problem set.

You may check on your progress through the test on the Progress page.
