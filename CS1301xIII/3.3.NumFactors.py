#Write a function called count_factors. count_factors should
#take as input one integer. It should return a count of the
#number of factors that number has. You should not include 1
#or the number itself among its factors.
#
#For example, count_factors(6) would return 2: 6 has two
#factors, 2 and 3.
#
#As a reminder, x is a factory of y if the remainder of
#dividing y by x is 0. In the case of count_factors(6), the
#answer is 2 because 6 % 2 = 0 and 6 % 3 = 0.


#Add your code here!
def count_factors(num):
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            print(num)



#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: 2, 0, 2, 6, each on their own line.
print(count_factors(6))
print(count_factors(7))
print(count_factors(8))
print(count_factors(24))
