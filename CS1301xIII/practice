mystery_string = "zizazzle"

#There are a few things we need to notice here:
#
# - First, we need to check the strings in the right order:
#   if we check 'z' before checking 'zzz', we're guaranteed
#   to find 'z' even if 'zzz' is there.
# - Second, we need to use elif: once we've found something,
#   we want to stop. Otherwise if "zzz" was in the string,
#   it would print all three messages.
# - Third, we could take care of the case where there is no
#   'z' with an else, or with another elif if we use the
#   condition 'not "z" in mystery_string'.
#
#So, here's how we'd do it:

if "zzz" in mystery_string:
    print("I'm sleepy...")
elif "zz" in mystery_string:
    print("I love ZZ Top!")
elif "z" in mystery_string:
    print("One is the loneliest number.")
else:
    print("Who needs z anyway?")
