#Write a function called random_marks. random_marks should
#take three parameters, all integers. It should return a
#string.
#
#The first parameter represents how many apostrophes should
#be in the string. The second parameter represents how many
#quotation marks should be in the string. The third
#parameter represents how many apostrophe-quotation mark
#pairs should be in the string.
#
#For example, random_marks(3, 2, 3) would return this
#string: #'''""'"'"'"
#
#Note that there are three apostrophes, then two quotation
#marks, then three '" pairs.


#Add your function here!
def random_marks(apostrophes, quotes, pairs):
    result = "'" * apostrophes
    result += '"' * quotes
    result += ("'" + '"') * pairs   
    return result


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: '''""'"'"'"

print(random_marks(3, 2, 3))
