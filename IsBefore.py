import datetime
start_date = datetime.date(2017, 2, 16)

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Above, there are four variables: start_date, end_date,
#start_time, and end_time. start_date and start_time together
#represent a certain time on a certain date, and end_date and
#end_time represent a different time on a different date.
#
#Add some code below that will print True if the end time
#occurs after the start time. Print False if the end time
#occurs before the start time. For example, 11:15:00 on
#01/01/2017 would be before 09:00:00 on 01/05/2017, which
#would be before 11:25:00 on 01/05/2017.
#
#Note that you may use dot notation to access the individual
#parts of the dates and times. You can access the hour,
#minute, and seconds from start_time with start_time.hour,
#start_time.minute, and start_time.second. You can access
#the year, month, and day of start_date with
#start_date.year, start_date.month, and start_date.day. You
#can use the same syntax to access the parts of end_date.
#Note that Python uses 24-hour time.
#
#Hint: You may use conditionals to solve this if you want,
#but you don't need to.
#
#Hint 2: You can use relational operators with both dates
#and times. start_time < end_time is True if start_time is
#before end_time. start_date >= end_date is True if
#start_date is later than end_date, or the same date. With
#this, you can avoid using dot notation altogether if
#you'd like.


#Add your code here!

print((start_date <= end_date) and (start_time < end_time))
